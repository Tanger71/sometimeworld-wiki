# [Shuchu](Shuchu.md#)
> ...
## Intro
---
Shuchu is a fungus endemic to [Numentellus](./Numentellus.md#) and is worshiped and utilized by the [Islander](./Numentellus.md#.md#) peoples. The Shuchu technology has endless applications and mysteries that still have not been discovered by Humans.
## Ecosystem
---
The Shuchu works together with its environment to grow its own size and influence. It spreads under the earth over vast distances creating a mycelium that absorbs animal carcasses for nutrients and nerve tissue. Unlike many other fungi genera, rather than consuming an area, the Shuchu integrates its-self with an ecosystem to maximize and develop a renewable food source than just simply consuming. Shuchu will stimulate the growth of fruit bearing plants that grow over its mycelium using electrical current and supplementing it with nutrients found elsewhere in its network. Thus, with more available fruit and edible plants, more animal life is supported and more animal carcasses that can be absorbed by the network. *It essentially farms animals*.
### Animals
One thing to note is that Shuchu will not absorb the cells of a living animal, it understands that a living animal can multiply if given the chance to live out its life, resulting in more food for the fungus in the long term. In areas that have a Shuchu mycelium, there is typically an abnormally large animal population.
### Humans
The [Islanders](./Numentellus.md#.md#.md#) are aware of the mechanics of the Shuchu. They benefit from the fertilization properties of the mycelium to grow food and they respect the Shuchu by refraining form eating the meat of an animal. Furthermore, some groups of humans will hunt animals and leave their carcasses in the forest as a sacrifice to the Shuchu as they know that animal matter is what the fungus feeds on.
## Etymology
---
Shuchu, the name given to the fungus by the [Islanders](./Numentellus.md#.md#.md#), comes from the Japanese word 主柱 (central pillar of society) but is also curiously a homonym with the word 手中 (in ones own control). 
## Fungal Technology
---
Humans have discovered a ways to influence the fungus to perform mechanical and electrical functions. Takes advantage of their conductive and material properties.
Uses include, weapons, logistics, communication, and body modification. See: [Fungal Technology](./Fungal%2520Technology.md#)
## Appearance
---
Shuchu exists mostly in its mycelium "roots" but visually manifests naturally as a fruiting body. Its stem and cap have a faint blue colour and glow, most visible in low light. Its spores also have a faint glow and appear like floating blue fireflies around the fruiting bodies.

## Quotes
---
> The fungus is relentless and horizontally organized... you can chop and burn all you are able, but there is always more... and theres no root, no head to cut off, no king to slay. 

> There is no hope in fighting anymore... It's already under our feet, on our food, in our bodies...

## Notes / Research / Questions
---

how is it fueled?
- neuron matter? dead animals are best. especially humans and their brain matter.
- symbiotic (Remoras)

what happens if you eat one?
- 

how is it used by humans?
- biotech, implants (AVATAR??)
- weapons that propel projectiles using charged metal. quite crudely. so not good accuracy.
- used for communication. Intelligence interface (brain)
	- tap into ground fungal network, {cyber psycho??}
	- FAST TRAVEL (player option)
- humans can interface with the fungus through a fungal neural link with their brain … due to fungus’ passive nature, it will not tamper with the brain that is alive with neurons firing unless it is starving. instead, it cooperates and submits to the brain (a co-existance)
	- with this a jacked human can interface with fungal devices that require human input. much like in avatar when they connect their hair things.

What does it look like?
- blue glowing ... bioluminiecence.
- coral-like fruits. of different types
	- Sharp/Hard
	- Spongey
- mainly in vein-like patterns below the surface.
	- when removed from the ground, a ropey stringiness
	- white with slight blue glow.
- 

{small group names for fungus, such as isolated in machines or an interface}
- Platoon
- Cluster
- Constellation
- Fleet

- current from where?
	- battery
		- used to farm grow fungus?

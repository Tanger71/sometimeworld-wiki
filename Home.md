# Sometimeworld
> The notes and lore for a world where fungal bio-technology meets medieval society.

## Intro & Hook
The transistor, invented in 1947, is the basis for modern digital computing. It is essentially a simplified and binary version of the neurons in an animals brain. I was thinking about this and began to consider fungus. Fungus are a form of cellular life are able to build a network of tissue that transmit electrical signals, much like an animal brain. However unlike animals, fungus, as a single entity, can span extreme distances compared to even the largest animal. So basically, Fungi can form a large network of fungal "neurons" that can span up to 6.5 square kilometers. This line of thinking lead me to the possibility that fungi, in the right environment and *imagination*, could form the foundation for biocomputing far before humans developed transistors and digital computing. This idea is leveraged in ***Sometimeworld***.

Sometimeworld takes place in a feudal world where wars are fought with steel swords and armor. A secondary party from a remote island invades the continent and brings with it a new form of technology centered around a special type of Fungus, [Shuchu](./Shuchu.md#). This is a time of major transition as regimes, culture, and technology are all effected by the newcomers and the [[./Shuchu|Shuchu]].

## Setting
Three years after its restoration, the previously isolated island natino of [Numentellus](./Numentellus.md#) begun a campaign with the goal of conquering and colonizing the [Mainland](Archaina.md#). Normally, their numbers and weapons technology would have been no match for the mainland with their copper age technology, but they processed control of the [Shuchu](./Shuchu.md#). With the power of the fungus, they outmatch traditional steel and early gunpowder and quickly gain power over the land. Sometimeworld takes place in the transitionary period where the world is just beginning to understand the capabilities and experiment with the extents of the fungus.

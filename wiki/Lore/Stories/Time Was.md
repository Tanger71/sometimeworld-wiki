## Summary
---
Aition Grew up in a small fishing town on the east coast of [The Mainland](../../../Archaina.md#). Becoming bored of his life and having doubts about his future there, he joins a crew who is setting sale for new lands.

He eventually lands on a remote island with people. Their culture seems to be more primitive than back home: bronze age, tribal, hunter-gather. He settles for a time in a small [{mountain village}]({mountain%20village}) and learns their language and ways. He shows the locals his steel tools, his sword, and tells them of his homeland. Wars, riches, nations, and *Land*: more land that could be possibly controlled by one King. 

One particular local, [Maqsud](../../../Maqsud.md#), takes exceptional attention to these stories. 
*"What if I could rule all that land?"* 
	-> Branch into: [The One King](../../../The%2520One%2520King.md#)

The [{fungal_religion}](../../../%7Bfungal_religion%7D.md#) seizes [{mountain village}]({mountain%20village}) and only one person resists, perishing at the hands of [Maqsud](../../../Maqsud.md#)'s own Edge, and leaving a young child as orphan. Aition knows this child as [young child]({young%20child}), and takes him under his wing as they make off for a new home, away from the [{fungal_religion}](../../../%7Bfungal_religion%7D.md#). 

They wander island for several years. Over this time, the [{fungal_religion}](../../../%7Bfungal_religion%7D.md#) begins to gain influence, making more Shuchu technology available. Most significantly, for Aition, [Edges](../Professions/Edges%2520Wielder.md#). Because the Edges burned white-hot, his steel sword became deprecated and no longer served him in protecting himself and [{young child}]({young%20child}). Since he was familiar with his steel sword, his transition to an Edge was more seamless than most, who were used to bronze spears and bows. 

The [{fungal_religion}](../../../%7Bfungal_religion%7D.md#) begins rapidly seizing power using their new fungal technology and religion to unite the island under one name =={...}==. Due to nationalistic and cultural instability on the island, Aition decides to return home and document his travels and discoveries back in the [Mainland](../../../Archaina.md#.md#). He brings the boy because, just like his younger self, he doubts his future in Numentellus.

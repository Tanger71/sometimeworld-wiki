## Summary
---
Oscar, an adolescent boy probably too young to fight, wakes up laying on the battlefield with his cut open. Likely was knocked out and thought dead by both friend and foe. The battle was over … seemingly, both sides were quiet. Whoever won the fight had likely moved on from the area leaving most of the dead behind, on the ground. *Weird*, most people would collect their dead and burn or bury them later. the boy spots a fellow soldier close to his age.

After greeting, the other boy points out Oscars injury. Oscar is confused because he doesn't seem to feel too much pain. it also seems like the hole in his hand has filled with this blue gunk. He should definitely get that checked out ... but he does not seem to be in critical condition. The other boy suggests to scavenge the armor and weapons of the dead to sell or use in future battles. ==boy finds fungal weapon and some weak armor?== 

follows friend for a bit, meets first boss. friend dies… oscar faces boss. saved by Aition.

Oscar, rattled at the loss of his new friend, follows [Aition](../Characters/Aition.md#) briefly seeking guidance and knowledge of the Shuchu.

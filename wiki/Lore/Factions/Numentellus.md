# [Numentellus](Numentellus.md#) 
(and its people)
## Intro
---
Home of the Numentellian peoples. It is located to the East of the [Archaina](../../../Archaina.md#).
## Etymology
---
The name is derived from the latin word *numen* (divine) and *tellus* (land, region).
## Ecosystem 
---
Numentellian are vegetarians. They benefit from the [Shuchu fertilization](../Shuchu.md##Ecosystem) property to get large crop yields. In return, they hunt for animals and leave their carcass to be absorbed by the fungus. In the local religion, it is treated at a sacrifice to their godly entity in return for crop fertility. 
## Politics
---
Historically, Numentellian have lived in smaller groups of people throughout the island relative peace aside from rare bouts over land and resources. Generally, thanks to the fungus, everyone was well fed and lived a life of excess. This was changed recently when a religious warlord representing the [{fungal_religion}](../../../%7Bfungal_religion%7D.md#) unified the island after taking advantage of the offensive utility of the fungus. They did not stop there, colonizing lands overseas and eventually reaching the [Archaina](../../../Archaina.md#).
## Technology
---
Apart from Shuchu technology, the Numentellian are otherwise quite primitive. Crutched by the support of the fungus, Numentellians never had the motivation or need to innovate along the traditional pathway as the rest of the world: traditional agriculture, steel, gunpowder. Instead, they have innovated within the path of the Shuchu, developing somewhat analogous and extensions to traditional technology. Most of their technology after the [{fungal_religion}](../../../%7Bfungal_religion%7D.md#) is composed of wood, copper, and fungal tissue. See [Fungal Utility](../Shuchu.md##Fungal%2520Utility)

It is thought that Numentellus diverged from the outer world and developed its own technological pathway just before the widespread use of steel tools and irrigation; They are still in the Bronze Age.
## Usage of Shuchu
---
As described in [Fungal Utility](../Shuchu.md.md##Fungal%2520Utility), The [{fungal_religion}](../../../%7Bfungal_religion%7D.md#) have found many uses for the fungus. However, for thousands of years the extent of its uses were limited to [Agrarian](../Shuchu.md##Humans)
## Notes
---
- they named the fungus {…} based off the idea of them, not the name fungus. Ryōshu master
- not much metal and resources there either ... thus, the copper and fungal technology. their modern technological progression was stunted by the fungi. the fungi is the only reason their population can be so high with their tech.
- Is Numentellus the *Garden of Eden*??

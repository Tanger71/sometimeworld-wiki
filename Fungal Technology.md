# Fungal Technology
Humans have discovered a ways to influence the fungus to perform mechanical and electrical functions. Takes advantage of their conductive and material properties. Many of these devices have copper chassis and hardened fungus as the connective tissue.
## Human interface
---
Can interface with humans by being exposed to **living** nerve tissue. Most users choose to bind with the fungus through their hands and arms to get extended functionality from their tools. Simple devices with a small number of controlled variables can be operated thought Median interface, connected at the hand or along the arm. More complex devices mush be connected directly through the brain, using a neural interface.
### Median Interface
... hands/arm ... 
### Neural Interface
The extreme users bind with the fungus directly through their brain. They do this by undergoing a procedure consisting of removing a portion of their skull and introducing a fungal stem into the cavity. Overtime, the fungus will integrate with the users conscious. Eventually, the fungus is influenced to form a hardened shell and fill the skull cavity while still maintaining a neural interface. The user can then consciously connect and communicate with devices and others by connecting their neural interface with another.

## Uses
---
### Communication
Across long distances where a fungal bed exists.
### Information Computation and Storage
Due to the conductive and semi-conductive properties of the Shuchu, complex circuitry and neural structures are able to be formed within its network. This allows it to store and compute information similar to that of both computers and humans. This however, is not the Shuchu's natural state. Wherever it occurs, it is likely a structure induced by a human. See: [{human computers}]({human%20computers)
### Projectiles
Originally made using brass frame and fungal mechanics, uses electro-magnetic fields to project matter in some direction. Effectively acting as guns. These are generally subsonic, but paired with high damaging projectiles is still more than fatal.

### Edges
Fungus can send an inductive charge through conductive material to heat it. These blades store a [{metal}]({metal}.md) that greatly expands when heated but still maintaining rigid form, allowing for a blue-white-hot extendible blade much like a "light saber" from the *Star Wars* franchise. These *Edges* require a Median Interface to control the blade extension and heat. Some users have developed unique extensions to their Edges by making use of the fungus' properties. See: [Edges Wielder](./Edges%2520Wielder.md#)
### Chimera
Because the fungus can interface with an animal's nervous system, it is also able to bridge nerve and biological pathways between tissue of genetically different humans and animals. This opens up an incredibly wide range of possibilities like brain-to-brain communication, enhancement and exchange of body parts, and medical limb and organ replacement. See: [Chimera](Chimera.md#)

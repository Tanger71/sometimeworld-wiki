Seeks to find his place in the world that has left him behind






<br>

<br><br><br><br>Aition grew up in a relatively small fishing town. He worked as a hand in the cargo convoys to and from <a class="internal-link" data-href="Montmark.md" href="wiki/locations/montmark.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Montmark</a>, a nearby city controlled by a lord. Doing so, he picked up lots of gossip and political knowledge of the many nations of Archaina.<br>meh

<br>As he got older, he was recruited into a militia
<br>learned to use the sword and fight. was quite good at it. 
<br>Growing up, Aition was good at most things ... but he was always the second best.

<br>Low ego ... low confidence despite talent
<br>childhood rival high ego ... will do anything for the leg up



<br><br>What is Aitions motivation for the driving plot?

<br>Saving family member?
<br>Killing Maqsud?
<br>Just getting out of a tight spot, but getting cornered at every angle? 

<br>out of the frying pan, into the fire ... constantly


<br>

<br><br><br>temp
When growing up in <a class="internal-link" data-href="Archaina.md" href="wiki/locations/archaina.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Archaina</a>, Aition was not fond of living amongst others. He found most people petty and superficial, bickering over insecurities and spreading rumours. He wants no part of this and spends the majority of his day avoiding stepping on the toes of others. This often leads him to pick the most frictionless course of action if it means less hassle and energy being spent over meaningless quarrels. In this way, Aition is often perceived as self centred due to his lack of interest in others... because he is. But not in a dubious way where he will gloat or step on others to get ahead. He knows his place in the world, but just doesn't have much concern or respect for those around him. He is closed off from others, shrouded behind a protective veil.<br>
This attitude begins to shift as he spends time on <a class="internal-link" data-href="Numentellus.md" href="wiki/locations/numentellus.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">the island</a>, and grows an appreciation for cooperation and community. This development culminates with the adoption of <a class="internal-link" data-href="{young child}.md" href="{young child}" target="_self" rel="noopener">{young child}</a> as he finally decides to open his life up to others and discovers the value of service and family.

<br>
while the world around him is resisting the new fungal order, Aition chooses to assimilate with the newcomers and find his new place in the world. 

<br>
Aition begins as a traveler/pirate/sailor who finds Numentellus. He gets to know the culture and society briefly.

<br>
he learns from a young orphaned boy who he meets soon after his village is razed

<br>the boy learns much about life from Aition… lessons that span cultures and societies. abstract and not bound to upbringing. 
<br>Aition learns much from the boy, of the Shuchu and the islanders’ way of life
<br>Since the boy has no family and is ambitious, he follows Aition to the mainland
<br>just after the invasion, the boy passes away from the acts of the mainlander's xenophobic actions, his own people.
<br>Aition is torn between what side is right or wrong... he travels the land in search for his place in the world. 
<br>this is where his story starts


<br>
a mainlander who wears the clothes of an invader

<br>
he comes across Oscar in his journeys and reminds him of the young islander boy. Out of avoidance and pain, he neglects Oscar leading Oscar to seek mentorship and father-ship elsewhere.

<br>
traits: quiet, 

<br>
After returning to <a class="internal-link" data-href="Archaina.md" href="wiki/locations/archaina.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mainland</a> from <a class="internal-link" data-href="Numentellus.md" href="wiki/locations/numentellus.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Numentellus</a>, Aition is estranged by how different it is.

<br>
He has expected to be welcomes with open arms with the new discoveries and technology he brought back. But most seemed disinterested with his Edge and his fungal technology. Overshadowed by the explosive new discovery, gunpowder.

<br>New King, new politics, new weapons, new religion, and an Aition, who was left behind with the old times and a few Numentellion party tricks.

<br>

<br><br><br>Founder of the <a class="internal-link" data-href="Neovenia.md" href="wiki/misc/neovenia.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Neovenia</a> religion and the father of <a class="internal-link" data-href="Shuchu Technology.md" href="wiki/misc/shuchu-technology.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Shuchu Technology</a>. He has a weird fantasy obsession with the many cultures of <a class="internal-link" data-href="Archaina.md" href="wiki/locations/archaina.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Archaina</a> to the extent of changing his name and {...}.<br><br>Originating from the hyperbolized and flowery stories of <a class="internal-link" data-href="Aition.md" href="wiki/characters/aition.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aition</a>'s homeland, Maqsud grew an obsession with the many cultures of <a class="internal-link" data-href="Archaina.md" href="wiki/locations/archaina.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Archaina</a>. Although Aition told his stories from his own perspective as a young serf under a feudal lord, Maqsud grew a romanticized view of the structure and simplicity of the Mainland's class system and concept of ownership. However, being from an isolated island with no personal experience and understanding of the cultural density and nuances of <a class="internal-link" data-href="Archaina.md" href="wiki/locations/archaina.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Archaina</a> and raised on an island where there is not much diversity in ethnicity and culture, he does not even fully grasp that the many cultures, languages, and customs of <a class="internal-link" data-href="Archaina.md" href="wiki/locations/archaina.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Archaina</a> are actually separate from each-other. His interpretation is aptly warped and distorted by his own projections of ambition, greed, and control. Due to this, he bastardizes the Archanian structures, names, and ideas with the conception of his own nation, <a class="internal-link" data-href="Numentellus.md" href="wiki/locations/numentellus.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Numentellus</a>.<br>How can I present to the player without feeling too forced?
Mainland npcs complaining about how the new compulsory religion is messed up?
<br><br>Maqsud was born in the small mountain-side town of {...} on Aopuru under the name, Tāne. He has always had a general curiosity for chemistry, machinery, and discovering how the world works. At the age of 13, he stole {...} from a farmer in his town because {...}. A typical punishment for this would be to cut the median nerve of the thief's right hand. The farmer, a having a young son himself, chose to show mercy by severing his left hand so that he could still be useful to society using his right. Tāne was left-handed.<br>
He is pretty butt-hurt about losing his dominant hand and begins searching for ways that he can restore its functionality. He is quite clever and, while experimenting with his early form of batteries, notices how sending short electrical charges into his <a class="internal-link" data-href="Shuchu.md#Shuchu Scar" href="wiki/misc/shuchu.html#Shuchu_Scar" target="_self" rel="noopener">Shuchu Scar</a> will sometimes make his body move. He continued researching this phenomenon, as well as ways to possibly use this in the reverse direction. At the age of 17, he develops the first early <a class="internal-link" data-href="Shuchu Technology.md" href="wiki/misc/shuchu-technology.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Shuchu Technology</a> controlled using his Median Interface.<br>
When he first meets Aition in the year 981, he is inspired by the stories from the mainland: their steel swords, armour, nations, and Kings. He begins developing the early prototypes for the <a class="internal-link" data-href="Toa.md" href="wiki/proficiency/toa.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Edge</a> and uses them to control a small number of towns in the area. It's here where he founds <a class="internal-link" data-href="Neovenia.md" href="wiki/misc/neovenia.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Neovenia</a> and begins the process of the <a class="internal-link" data-href="The Great Conversion.md" href="wiki/misc/the-great-conversion.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">The Great Conversion</a>.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br>Maqsud is much like Aition, not fond of cities, crowded places... but his anxieties manifest much differently... a thematic foil to aition

<br>Shuchu represents the underworld as it is where your body returns to after your soul (electricity) fades.

<br><br>Idea
It is said that the Messiah will arise and slay Maqsud, bringing peace to his tyranny and violent ways. This prophecy is said to have been fulfilled by {...}. But it turns out {...} is just Maqsud in disguise and the entire "prophecy" was just conceived to cleanse the church of the atrocities Maqsud committed on Archaina to establish the church. The player learns of this and decides to take this Messiah title upon their-self.
<br><br><br>Maqsud assigned the four Acolytes, adhering to the classical elements, their themes, and their purpose to the Neovenian Church. Each of these Acolytes hold meaning to Numentellian culture but also serve as a tragic cautionary tale to the followers.<br><br>Persephone, the acolyte corresponding to Water of the four elements. Her symbolism extends to themes of Entropy, Harvest, and Sin. As Acolyte of the harvest, she represents the Shuchu's symbiotic plant stimulation but, despite that, commits the great sin by defying Maqsud and consuming the flesh of another animal. Maqsud displays his solidarity to the Acolytes by issuing a dispensation rather than killing Persephone, but shows his authority by sentencing her to eternal fasting in the {underworld}. Thus, she is awarded the alternate title, Nestis.

<br><br><br>Shuchu is a fungus endemic to <a class="internal-link" data-href="Numentellus.md" href="wiki/locations/numentellus.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Numentellus</a> and is worshiped and utilized by the <a class="internal-link" data-href="Numentellus.md" href="wiki/locations/numentellus.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Islander</a> peoples. The Shuchu technology has endless applications and mysteries that still have not been discovered by Humans.<br><br><br>The Shuchu works together with its environment to grow its own size and influence. It spreads under the earth over vast distances creating a mycelium that absorbs animal carcasses for nutrients and nerve tissue. Unlike many other fungi genera, rather than consuming an area, the Shuchu integrates its-self with an ecosystem to maximize and develop a renewable food source than just simply consuming. Shuchu will stimulate the growth of fruit bearing plants that grow over its mycelium using electrical current and supplementing it with nutrients found elsewhere in its network. Thus, with more available fruit and edible plants, more animal life is supported and more animal carcasses that can be absorbed by the network. It essentially farms animals.<br><br>One thing to note is that Shuchu will not absorb the cells of a living animal, it understands that a living animal can multiply if given the chance to live out its life, resulting in more food for the fungus in the long term. In areas that have a Shuchu mycelium, there is typically an abnormally large animal population.<br><br>The <a class="internal-link" data-href="Numentellus.md" href="wiki/locations/numentellus.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Islanders</a> are aware of the mechanics of the Shuchu. They benefit from the fertilization properties of the mycelium to grow food and they respect the Shuchu by refraining form eating the meat of an animal. Furthermore, some groups of humans will hunt animals and leave their carcasses in the forest as a sacrifice to the Shuchu as they know that animal matter is what the fungus feeds on.<br><br><br>Shuchu, the name given to the fungus by the <a class="internal-link" data-href="Numentellus.md" href="wiki/locations/numentellus.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Islanders</a>, comes from the Japanese word 主柱 (central pillar of society) but is also curiously a homonym with the word 手中 (in ones own control). <br><br><br>Humans have discovered a ways to influence the fungus to perform mechanical and electrical functions. Takes advantage of their conductive and material properties.<br>
Uses include, weapons, logistics, communication, and body modification. See: <a class="internal-link" data-href="Shuchu Technology.md" href="wiki/misc/shuchu-technology.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Shuchu Technology</a><br><br>When a human is wounded, and their wound is exposed to the fungus, it will begin to disinfect and fill the wound with a hard blue tissue. Many <a class="internal-link" data-href="Numentellus.md" href="wiki/locations/numentellus.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Numentellian</a> have these Shuchu scar around their body akin to regular scars. These patches are the foundation to Shuchu technology as they provide the electrical-nervous interface that Shuchu tech is founded on.<br><br><br>Shuchu exists mostly in its mycelium "roots" but visually manifests naturally as a fruiting body. Its stem and cap have a faint blue colour and glow, most visible in low light. Its spores also have a faint glow and appear like floating blue fireflies around the fruiting bodies.<br>{smth about the mycelium glowing under certain circumstances}<br><br>

<br>FAST TRAVEL (player option)


<br>humans can interface with the fungus through a fungal neural link with their brain … due to fungus’ passive nature, it will not tamper with the brain that is alive with neurons firing unless it is starving. instead, it cooperates and submits to the brain (a co-existance)

<br>with this a jacked human can interface with fungal devices that require human input. much like in avatar when they connect their hair things.

Any organism that is a fusion or composition of one or more animals or organisms. This is made possible by the neuron interface function of the Shuchu.
<br><br><br>Using the Shuchu's neural interfacing property, it can be used to fuse together body parts and limbs from one organism to another. This often takes the form of replacing limbs with those of the same species (ie. human to human) but also extends to implanting specialized organs to serve a purpose. In rarer cases, some ambitious humans are known to experiment with body parts of animals that drastically vary from their own genetic makeup. Because of the Shuchu's symbiotic nature, it is able to keep the both parties alive and healthy by osmotically transferring nutrients across its barrier.<br><br>The challenges of going "off gene" are that there is a higher likelihood of the auxiliary organ to be incompatible with the nutrients naturally produced by the host. This can lower the effectiveness of the organ and also cause its cells to die, leading to further complications such as infection and decay. Because of this, hosts with highly variable organs, often must  supplement their organs to supply the necessary nutrients or have new organs implanted to produce those nutrients autonomously. <br><br><br>Uses widely vary from replacement/enhancement/supplement of existing organs or body parts to completely new structures added to the body.<br><br>

Those who wield Edges, <a class="internal-link" data-href="Shuchu Technology.md#Median Interface" href="wiki/misc/shuchu-technology.html#Median_Interface" target="_self" rel="noopener">Median</a> gadgets that serve a similar purpose to a sword but rather than slicing with a blade, it burns through its target with white-hot metal. Like a "light-saber" from the Star Wars franchise, they can extend and retract into their handle. 
<br><br><br>Controlled by a <a class="internal-link" data-href="Shuchu Technology.md#Median Interface" href="wiki/misc/shuchu-technology.html#Median_Interface" target="_self" rel="noopener">Median Interface</a>, the user must learn to control the amount of current continuously being supplied to the copper coil. Under-heating the {metal} will yield a cold and short blade. Over-heating the {metal} will lead to a soft blade prone to deformation or in-extreme cases, melting. <br>Edges are used very similarly to a traditional sword, but rather than cutting, the edge will burn right through the target. Most edges are hot enough to effortlessly pass through most flesh and materials. However, it has a more difficult time with steel, often bouncing off with a strike but softening it with heat in the process.<br>When used for prolonged periods, the blade and internals of the handle will get too hot to wield. Some users mitigate this by lowering the heat of their coils (conversely effecting their cutting ability) or other creative solutions. However, all users deal with the problem of overheating at some point or another.<br><br>This takes takes new users around 1-4 months of prehabilitation depending on the maturity of their median interface. It takes new users a large amount of concentration while in combat to simultaneously maintain a steady level of current to their coil. Consistency and quality of current is referred to by wielders as edge quality. It takes new users up to 4 seconds to extend and retract their blade.<br>Quote
"The blade quality was so poor, his edge functioned more like a searing club then a blade"
<br><br>More experienced users do not have to concentrate on their edge quality and can also extend and retract their blade much faster than beginners.<br><br>Seasoned Toa with a coordinated median interface, can extend their blades near instantaneously and even expand and retract during combat to give them more offensive options. They also are able to adjust their "edge quality" depending on the situation. This can depend on weather, armour of opponent, or to elongate the usage time before their handle overheats.<br><br><br>The handle of the Edge device is typically made of a brass chassis with a <a class="internal-link" data-href="Shuchu.md" href="wiki/misc/shuchu.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Shuchu</a> interface near the hilt. Inside the chassis, there is a copper induction coil around a narrow cylinder of {metal}. The inside of the chassis is insulated with a silicone/rubber material to keep the handle from heating too much. <br><br>When the copper coil is provided with a current, the {metal} will expand in the direction of its cylindrical base and out the open end of the handle. The metal will expand proportionally to the heat it is given from the copper coil and begin to glow blue.<br><br>In addition to controlling their handle's current, wielders must supply large amount of power to their Edge. This must come from some battery or capacitive cell. Early in the development stage of these weapons, crude batteries, designed<br><br>

 <br>Deprecated in suspension<br><br>
This is partially inspired by the opening of Vagabond. A possibly entry point for a journey or ground zero explanation.
<br><br><br>Oscar, an adolescent boy probably too young to fight, wakes up laying on the battlefield. Likely was knocked out and thought dead by both friend and foe very early on in the bout. The battle was over … seemingly, both sides were quiet. Whoever won the fight had likely moved on from the area leaving most of the dead behind, on the ground. Weird, most people would collect their dead and burn or bury them later. Oscar spots a fellow soldier close to his age, introduced as <a class="internal-link" data-href="Tanner.md" href="wiki/characters/tanner.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tanner</a>.<br>After greeting, the other boy points out Oscars injury. Oscar is confused because he doesn't seem to feel too much pain. It seems that his right arm is completely severed at the elbow and the open wound filled with this blue gunk, stopping the bleeding. He should definitely get that checked out ... but he does not feel any pain and seem to be in no danger of dying after all. The other boy suggests to scavenge the armour and weapons of the dead to sell or use in future battles. He notices that many of the dead laying in the mud have the same blue wounds as his. <br>After looking around, Oscar finds some weird looking gadgets he stuffs into his bag as well as a short sword he can wield with his non-dominant hand. As they traverse the battlefield, they test their new weapons by hacking on corpses and finishing off the mortally wounded. He follows Tanner for a bit, and comes across an healthy <a class="internal-link" data-href="Numentellus.md" href="wiki/locations/numentellus.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Invader</a>. <br>Tanner jumps in front of Oscar, considering Oscar has only one arm, and is cut down with relative ease thanks to the invader's white-hot <a class="internal-link" data-href="Toa.md" href="wiki/proficiency/toa.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Edge</a>.<br>Oscar steps back, in fear and awe at the invader and his wicked blade of light. He suddenly remembers the moments before he was knocked unconscious. He remembered being approached by this very invader and the beginning of the battle and being cut down before he could even process what was happening.<br>He drops his steel sword and raises his hands, understanding he is no match for his opponents sword of light. The invader retracts her blade of light back into her handle and stands by, analyzing Oscar's missing arm and recalling the preceding events. Seemingly impressed (by his affinity to the fungal interface), she approaches Oscar, picks up his sword and places it in Oscars hand. "She wants to fight me again". <br>Should Oscar lose his arm in the 1-1 bout with the invader, instead of the initial battle?<br>After a short exchange, Oscar is overpowered by the invader and held at edge-point on the ground. She goes for a final blow, which Oscar parries to the side with his steel sword. Before the invader is able to make her second attempt, she is interrupted by <a class="internal-link" data-href="Aition.md" href="wiki/characters/aition.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aition</a> who had noticed the exchange from the tree line and decided to intervene. They have a brief exchange where Aition ultimately slices her across the abdomen. <br>Oscar stands up and rips the retracted Edge from the invader's cold hands. Still rattled at the loss of his new friend and in awe of these light swords that he now possess, he follows <a class="internal-link" data-href="Aition.md" href="wiki/characters/aition.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aition</a> as they continue across the battlefield.<br>Oscar, puzzled at how these devices work, begins to ask about Aition and how he had learned how to use one and about the mysterious blue gunk.<br>Aition reacted standoffish to Oscar, still recently upset by the loss of <a class="internal-link" data-href="{young child}" href="{young child}" target="_self" rel="noopener">{young child}</a> and determined to reach the front line of the invasion. He tells Oscar he has no use for this device due to his missing arm and to return home and trade the device for ...<br>A loud bang is heard in the distance... likely gunpowder. Oscar is left behind in the middle of the forest as Aition continues forward towards it.<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>turning out similar to the incredibles.

The notes and lore for a world where fungal bio-technology meets medieval society.
<br><br>The transistor, invented in 1947, is the basis for modern digital computing. It is essentially a simplified and binary version of the neurons in an animals brain. I was thinking about this and began to consider fungus. Fungus are a form of cellular life are able to build a network of tissue that transmit electrical signals, much like an animal brain. However unlike animals, fungus, as a single entity, can span extreme distances compared to even the largest animal. So basically, Fungi can form a large network of fungal "neurons" that can span up to 6.5 square kilometers. This line of thinking lead me to the possibility that fungi, in the right environment and imagination, could form the foundation for biocomputing far before humans developed transistors and digital computing. This idea is leveraged in Sometimeworld.<br>Sometimeworld takes place in a feudal world where wars are fought with steel swords and armor. A secondary party from a remote island invades the continent and brings with it a new form of technology centered around a special type of Fungus, <a class="internal-link" data-href="Shuchu.md" href="wiki/misc/shuchu.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Shuchu</a>. This is a time of major transition as regimes, culture, and technology are all effected by the newcomers and the <a data-href="Shuchu" href="wiki/misc/shuchu.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Shuchu</a>.<br><br>Three years after its restoration, the previously isolated island nation of <a class="internal-link" data-href="Numentellus.md" href="wiki/locations/numentellus.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Numentellus</a> begun a campaign with the goal of conquering and colonizing the <a class="internal-link" data-href="Archaina.md" href="wiki/locations/archaina.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mainland</a>.

With the power of the fungus, they outmatch traditional steel and early gunpowder and quickly gain power over the land.

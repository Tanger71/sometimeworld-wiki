# [Edges Wielder](Edges%2520Wielder.md#)
> Edges are [Median](./Fungal%2520Technology.md##Median%2520Interface) gadgets that serve a similar purpose to a sword but rather than slicing with a blade, it burns through its target with white-hot metal. Like a "light-saber" from the *Star Wars* franchise, they can extend and retract into their handle. 
## Use
---
Controlled by a [Median Interface](./Fungal%2520Technology.md.md##Median%2520Interface), the user must learn to control the amount of current continuously being supplied to the copper coil. Under-heating the {metal} will yield a cold and short blade. Over-heating the {metal} will lead to a soft blade prone to deformation or in-extreme cases, melting. 

Edges are used very similarly to a traditional sword, but rather than cutting, the edge will burn right through the target. Most edges are hot enough to effortlessly pass through most flesh and materials. However, it has a more difficult time with steel, often bouncing off with a strike but softening it with heat in the process.

When used for prolonged periods, the blade and internals of the handle will get too hot to wield. Some users mitigate this by lowering the heat of their coils (conversely effecting their cutting ability) or other creative solutions. However, *all* users deal with the problem of overheating at some point or another.
### New users
This takes takes new users around 1-4 months of prehabilitation depending on the maturity of their median interface. It takes new users a large amount of concentration while in combat to simultaneously maintain a steady level of current to their coil. Consistency and quality of current is referred to by wielders as *edge quality*. It takes new users up to 4 seconds to extend and retract their blade.

### Adept users
More experienced users do not have to concentrate on their edge quality and can also extend and retract their blade much faster than beginners.
### Advanced users
Seasoned users with a coordinated median interface, can extend their blades near instantaneously and even expand and retract during combat to give them more offensive options. They also are able to adjust their edge quality depending on the situation. This can depend on weather, armour of opponent, or to elongate the usage time before their handle overheats.
## Mechanism
---
The handle of the Edge device is typically made of a brass chassis with a Shuchu interface near the hilt. Inside the chassis, there is a copper induction coil around a narrow cylindar of {metal}. The inside of the chassis is insulated with a silicone/rubber material to keep the handle from heating too much. 
### Activation
When the copper coil is provided with a current, the {metal} will expand in the direction of its cylindrical base and out the open end of the handle. The metal will expand proportionally to the heat it is given from the copper coil and begin to glow blue.
### {metal}
- cylindrical alloy that expands way more on the long axis than any other.
- very narrow blade... conductive heat transfer on touch is same, but radiative heat is much lower as it is proportional to area of emission.
- expands in single direction due to its atomic structure.

## Variations
---
Advanced users will often modify their blades or develop their own to suit their styles and preferences.
- form
- blade length
- multiple blades
